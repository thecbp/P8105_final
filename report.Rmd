<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

Colectomies are surgical procedures that remove all of part of your large intestine. These surgeries are performed for various reasons, ranging from bowel obstruction to colon cancer to just being preventative. Over 250,000 colectomies are performed each year in the United States alone, representing an estimated 10% of the total volume of general surgeries. Given the prolific nature of the surgery, the rate of post-operation complication is astounding: the average rate of complication approached 30% in the last 10 years<sup>[1](https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/711126)</sup>.

## Project Motivation

We wanted to investigate what factors contributed to increasing or decreasing the risk of post-operative complication, using a dataset on colectomies performed from 2014 - 2016 from multiple hospitals in Michigan. Using this data, we want to use this data for a regression analysis to figure out which variables have an impact on affecting post-surgery complication. 

We were inspired by the analyses done for Homework 6. Until then, our studies have only ever focused on simple linear regression, so being able to wield something to predict a binary outcome was new. With the binary nature of complication, we thought we could apply the same analyses here to good effect.

## Initial Questions

First, we needed to figure out if any other answers have been given for this question. If risk factors have already been established, then theoretically they should contribute significantly to a regression. We also needed to figure out what our outcome could be, since complication after a surgery can take many forms. 

We ended up deciding to use surgical site infection as our outcome of interest. After some exploring, we found that there was more literature dedicated to this particular outcome compared to another such as mortality. While we knew that making our own logistic regression would have been easy, we were also interested in creating a modelling application for others. It would be interesting to give interested users a subset of the data to create their own models, based on variables that they might find useful or that we may have not considered. This interest motivated us to create a Shiny application dedicated to this process.

<h1 id="characterize">Data Characterization</h1>

Before anything, we need to bring in the data and our toolkit for analyzing the data. In addition to `tidyverse`, we've created a set of helper functions and variables that we've stored in `utils.R` to save coding space. Our data will be stored in the `colectomies` variable. `leaps` and `caret` are used later for our regression analyses.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaps)
library(haven)
source("./utils.R")

# Formatting plot output
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  out.width = "90%"
)

# Set the plot design
theme_set(theme_classic() + 
            theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
                  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))

# Raw data
colectomies = read_dta(file = './colectomy_raw_new.dta') 
```

In its raw form, the data has `r nrow(colectomies)` rows and `r ncol(colectomies)` columns. Each row corresponds to a single colectomy and an incredible amount of information associated with it, including a bevy of laboratory, disease, surgery and patient data. 

A brief glance at the data showed us that many of the columns are useless for our analysis. Many columns contain mostly or only missing data. Before we can start variable selection for our model, we need to tidy up the dataset. 

<h1 id="tidying">Tidying the Data</h1>

## Data Reduction & Cleaning

To start the cleaning, we want to remove all columns that contain more than 50% missing values (either blank cells or `NA`). Furthermore, some of the columns actually contain duplicate information from others. These duplicate columns start with `flg` or `e`. 

```{r data-reduction }
tidy_colectomies = colectomies %>% 
  select(-starts_with("flg_"), -starts_with("e_")) %>% 
  select_if(unlist(map(., is_mostly_intact), use.names = FALSE)) %>% 
  prettify_names(.) 
```

Our function, `is_mostly_intact`, helps us identify columns that are more than 50% missing or blank. `prettify_names` helps us mass-change the column names in the dataset in a succinct way, leaving variables that are more informative to code with. After this purge, our reduced dataset now stands at `r nrow(tidy_colectomies)` rows and `r ncol(tidy_colectomies)` columns. 

## Data Cleaning

Many of the columns in the data appear to be numerical, but are in fact, categorical. Our `catfactory` function in `utils.R` contain all of our retyping. 

```{r data-cleaning, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
tidy_colectomies = tidy_colectomies %>%
  catfactory(.) %>% 
  mutate(any_ssi = (postop_ssi_super + postop_ssi_deep + 	postop_ssi_organspace) >= 1)
```

The outcome of interest we'll be focusing on is surgical site infection (SSI). After researching more into colectomies, we found that infection was the most common type of complication. We believe that focusing on this aspect of post-operation allows us to narrow down the scope of our analysis, while allowing for the greatest breadth for defining "complication". 

Surgical site infection (SSI) is actually contained in 3 particular columns (`postop_ssi_super`,  `postop_ssi_deep` and `postop_ssi_organspace`) in the dataset, which we'll compile into one summary variable `any_ssi`.

Even with all of the data reduction, there are still too many variables to know which to include in the regression. In aid in variable selection, we did a literature review to see what has relationships have been established. 

<h1 id="lit">Literature Review: Relevant Factors</h1>

Thankfully, several factors have been identified as risk factors for complications in colorectal surgery. Kirchoff established many risk factors in a 2010 paper on the subject. The paper found that age, gender, prior surgery, obesity, nutritional status and body weight loss were patient-related factors. Factors that were related to the surgery itself included: open access to abdominal cavity, blood loss, surgical approach switches and length of operating time<sup>[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765178)</sup>.

Ko et. al found that certain diseases were associated with increased risk of death post-colectomy, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, respiratory failure and shock<sup>[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765178)</sup>.

In another paper, Tang et. al focuses on risk factors associated with surgical site infection, our outcome of interest. Dr. Tang identified ASA score, blood transfusion, drainage use, and sex<sup>[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1422004)</sup>.

With these papers in mind, we know to include these in our regression analyses. We selected a few of these variables and others to explore more in our subanalyses below.

<h1 id="sub">Subanalyses</h1>

### Is there a relationship between SSI and insurance status?

One variable we thought would have a relationship to SSI was a patient's insurance status. We believed that patients with little to no coverage would be forced to go to less experienced hospitals and experience more SSI. To confirm or deny this belief, we looked at how SSIs were distributed by insurance staus. 

```{r insurance_analysis, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
insurance_df = tidy_colectomies %>% 
  select(., any_ssi, insurance_payment_type) %>% 
  mutate(insurance_payment_type = as.factor(insurance_payment_type)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(insurance_payment_type)) %>% 
  group_by(insurance_payment_type) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            total_SSI = sum(any_ssi),
            percent_SSI = 100 * (total_SSI / n))

knitr::kable(insurance_df)
```

We can see in the table that insurance types are not evenly distributed over the data. Thus, we need to compare percentages of colectomies that resulted in SSI instead of raw counts.

```{r insurance_plot, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = insurance_df,
       aes(x = insurance_payment_type,
           y = percent_SSI,
           fill = insurance_payment_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    x = "Insurance Payment Type",
    y = "Percent of colecotmies resulting in SSI",
    title = "Insurance Types and SSI"
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The insurance payment types are as follows:  
1. Medicare  
2. Medicare + Medicare Supplemental Plan/Medigap Insurance  
3. Medicaid  
4. Medicare AND Medicaid  
5. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM)  
6. Private Insurance, incl. HMO plans  
7. Other  
8. Self-Pay  
9. Uninsured  
10. International Patient  
11. Medicare Advantage - Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan

In the first table, we can see that the most occurences of SSIs are in patients with Medicare, Medicare + Medicare Supplemental Plan/Medigap Insurance, or those who are uninsured. However, those variables also had the greatest number of patients, so we can't solely rely on the absolute SSI counts to tell us anything useful. We must look at the percentages instead.

In the second plot, we can see the percentage of SSI occurences out of the total number of colectomies performed based on insurance type. There is generally no distinction between the insurance types, with most of the percentages hovering between 6 to 12 percent. Noticeably, patients with private insurance had a much higher percentage of SSIs at above 25 percent while patients with other insurance had 0 percent. However, this is most likely due to the small sample size of patients with those types of insurance and should not affect our conclusions.

In the end, our hypotheses was incorrect; there was seemingly no relationship between insurance type and occurence of SSIs. This result indicates it would be a poor candidate for predicting SSI.

### How are SSI distributed in patients with different diseases and prior conditions? (Tiffany's Analysis)

The Ko paper names multiple diseases that are associated with increased risk of SSI. Our dataset contains information on many of these diseases, so we wanted to investigate if our data supports any of Ko's findings. We have the following data below that corresponds to the paper:

  * Smoker: Tobacco use within 1 year
  * Etoh: >2 drinks/day two weeks prior to surgery
  * Body Weight Loss: 10% of body weight loss 6 months prior to surgery
  * Chf: Congestive Heart Failure within 30 days prior to surgery
  * Scd : Specific Carbohydrate Diet
  * Copd: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
  * Dvt: Deep Vein Thrombosis
  * Chronic Condition: steriods, immunosuppresive meds
  * Preop-transfusion: RBCs within 72 hours of surgery
  * Ventilator: ventilator dependent

```{r gathering-diseases, include = FALSE }
healthdisease = tidy_colectomies %>% 
  select(any_ssi, death_status, had_ascites, had_bleeding_disorder, had_body_weight_loss, 
         had_chf, had_copd, had_chronic_cond, had_c_artery_prob,
         had_diabetes, is_on_dialysis, had_dis_cancer, had_dvt,
         had_hypertension, had_pvd, had_pneumonia, had_preop_sepsis, had_preop_transfusion,
         had_sleep_apnea, is_smoker, had_etoh, is_on_ventilator, is_on_beta_blocker, 
         heparinbid, heparintid, had_scd, surgical_approach) %>% 
  select(-surgical_approach) %>% 
  mutate(had_ascites = ifelse(had_ascites == 2, 1, 0),
         had_preop_sepsis = ifelse(had_preop_sepsis == 1, 0, 1), 
         had_sleep_apnea = ifelse(had_sleep_apnea == 0, 0, 1)) %>%
  replace_na(list(had_dvt = 0, had_dis_cancer = 0, is_on_beta_blocker = 0, had_scd = 0,
                  heparinbid = 0, heparintid = 0))
```

```{r plotting-disease, warning = FALSE}
dist_data = healthdisease %>% 
  select(-any_ssi, -death_status) %>% 
  gather(condition, key) %>% 
  filter(key > 0) %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarize(cases = n()) %>% 
  mutate(condition = reorder(condition, -cases))

ggplot(dist_data, aes(x = condition, y = cases, fill = condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(
    title = "Pre-operative health conditions",
    x = "Diseases/Conditions",
    y = "Counts"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 40, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "none") 
```

We can see in the dataset that many of these conditions/diseases are relatively rare in the dataset. This may impact their significance in the regression, but we've established that there are patients with these characteristics.

#### SSI and death association to each health condition

To see how often a condition is related to SSI, we used a heatmap to see if any are particularly associated with SSI. We also looked at death as an outcome to see if any of these diseases are associated with it.

```{r givin-the-heat }
heatplot = healthdisease %>% 
  mutate(death_status = recode(death_status, `3` = "No death", `1` = "Died intraop", 
                        `2` = "Died within 30 days postop")) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  gather(condition, score, -death_status, -any_ssi) %>%
  gather(key, status, -condition, -score) %>% 
  select(-key) %>% group_by(status, condition) %>% 
  summarise(score = sum(score))

ggplot(data = heatplot, aes(x = status, y = condition, fill = score)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 40, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "none") +
  labs
```

Comparing number of death and SSI cases side by side with each health condition, we see a nearly symmetric heatmap. There are fewer cases under patients that actually got SSI (TRUE/FALSE) or died from the operation, so it is difficult to conclude any direct relationship between health condition and surgery outcome. Intrestingly, we can see that there are a great number of successful cases for patients with sleep apnea, specific carbohydrate diet, and hypertension related ot SSI. 

### How are SSI associated with ASA level?

Tang pointed out that ASA is related to SSI, so we investigate that trend in our data here. The ASA physical classification system is used to assess the fitness of patient fitness prior to surgery. The scale ranges from 1 to 6, where `1` is a healthy person and `6` is a brain-dead person. We would expect ASA to be associated with higher rates of SSI since patients on the higher scale have more severe systemic disease. 

```{r asa-vs-ssi }
asa_analysis = tidy_colectomies %>% 
  select(any_ssi, asa_class_id, postop_ssi_super, postop_ssi_deep, postop_ssi_organspace) %>% 
  mutate(ssi_type = ifelse(
           postop_ssi_super == 1, "Super",
           ifelse(postop_ssi_deep == 1, "Deep", 
                  ifelse(postop_ssi_organspace == 1, "OrganSpace", "None")
         ))) %>%
  rename(., ASA = asa_class_id) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(ASA)) %>% 
  group_by(ASA) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            n_SSIs = sum(any_ssi),
            percent_SSIs = n_SSIs/n) %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = ASA, y = n, fill = ASA)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of patients in each ASA level",
    x = "ASA classification",
    y = "Number of patients"
  )
```

The majority of cases are class 1, while the second most common is level 3. This is to be expected since colectomies are performed for a wide array of conditions. Now, we'll look at how SSIs occur as a function of ASA level.

```{r ssi-vs-asa-plot }
ggplot(data = asa_analysis, aes(x = ASA, y = percent_SSIs, fill = ASA)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Percent of cases in ASA level with SSI",
    x = "ASA classification",
    y = "Percentage of cases"
  )
```

We see that there is also an increasing trend in surgical site infections as the ASA severity gets higher. The rate of SSI is 3 times higher in class 4 patients than in class 1 patients. Thus, we've shown that as a colectomy's severity increases, the patient is slightly more likely to get an infection after their surgery. ASA classification is something we should include in the analysis.

<h1 id="regress">Regression Analysis</h1>

With our literature review and personal exploration of the data, we have a set of variables to use for our logistic regression. With our literature review, we've decided to start with a subset of 20 variables. These candidate variables have been shown to be associated with SSI, so we'll use automatic procedures to further cut down on covariates and get to a more robust, parsimonious model.

```{r sub-selection, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
# Selection of 20 candidate covariates for logistic regression
model_covariates = tidy_colectomies %>% 
  select(any_ssi, surgical_approach, had_etoh,
         had_hypertension, had_diabetes, surgical_wound_closure, 
         asa_class_id, is_smoker, bmi, age, sex, had_body_weight_loss,
         had_dvt, had_open_wound, had_pneumonia, had_preop_sepsis,
         had_preop_transfusion, had_epidural, admit_to_icu_postsurg, 
         val_surgtime, length_of_stay) %>% 
  na.omit(.)

just_covariates = model_covariates %>% select(-any_ssi) %>% colnames(.)

# Compactly create the full logistic model
full_fmla = as.formula(
  paste("any_ssi ~", paste(c(just_covariates), collapse = "+"))
)

# Models to help guide the automatic procedures
null = glm(any_ssi ~ 1, data = model_covariates, family = binomial())
full = glm(full_fmla, data = model_covariates, family = binomial())

# Stepwise regression to select best subset
step.model = step(null, direction = 'both', scope = list(upper = full))
```

The resulting stepwise regression results in a model with 23 covariates, with many of them stemming from categorical factors chosen. Out of these covariates, `length_of_stay`, `surgical_approaches` 2, 3 and 4, age, ASA level 3, admission to ICU, surgery time, and BMI remained statistically significant. 

<h1 id="conclusion">Discussion</h1>

We are pleased to see that many of the variables that we found during our literature found themselves in the model and were statistically significant. However, many of the variables that were found to be risk factors in SSI did not end up in the final model or were not statistically significant. Given the large amount of covariates and categorical variables we had to consider, it is highly likely that many elements that would have been included in a more parsimonious model were excluded thanks to the noise introduced by starting with 20 candidates.

Looking at the model coefficients, we can comment on how each factor affects the odds of SSI. High BMI, admission to the ICU, ASA class 3, being a smoker and long surgery times have positive coefficients, meaning that the odds of SSI in patients with these characteristics are higher than those without. Older patients, length of stay and surgical approaches 2 and 3 correspond with negative coefficients, indicating that odds of SSI are reduced in patients with these qualities.

Although far from perfect, our model gives us some insight into what pre-surgical disease/traits contribute to SSI and supports some of the research done on this particular subject. We believe that our results can be improved by starting with more parsimonious models and building the stepwise regression from there.
