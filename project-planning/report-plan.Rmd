## Introduction

* context about colectomy
* where does our data come from
* motivation for project

## Data Characterization

* how many rows and columns originally
* what are some key variables in the dataset?
  * hospital data, patient data, laboratory data, disease data
  * key outcome: SSI, surgical site infection
* brief summary of the above variables

## Data Cleaning

* remove columns with >50% missing values
* remove duplicated columns
* defining variables to keep from literature review
* renaming columns to be more informative
* recoding columns (0/1 to logical, categories to factors)

## Subanalyses

* how many different hospitals are represented in the data?
  * how many of their surgeries result in SSI?
* how are successes distributed by patients with different diseases - Tiffany
* how are successes distributed by insurance status? - Justin
* how are successes associated with ASA level? - Christian 
* does the number of surgeries & successes change with time?
* What variables do we keep for the logistic regression?

## Modeling - Christian

* make model based on variables of interest from subanalyses
* cross-validation 
* bootstrapping
* final model

## Conclusion - Christian

* What factors are associated with SSI?
  * positively? negatively?
* What factors ended up being non-significant?
